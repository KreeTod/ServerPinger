# ServerPinger
Few client-server scripts that ask server about status, working services and other data, and shows it in console.

I want to make it looks like aka "hacker-movie-tool".
Many dark colors, everything moves, green its good, red its something gone wrong.

But, this project is making because i need to monitor which of my servers works, which services are alive and ets.
